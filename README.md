# Hand-written-digit-recognition
This mini-project is a part of assignments given by the coursera course for Machine learning by Andrew Ng.\
We will implement the backpropagation algorithm for neural
networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.\
The machine learning language used here is Octave.\
As this is a assignment, some part of this is written by the TA's.\
The code is written on MATLAB and to run the written code, download or fork the repository and run the code on MATLAB.    
See the file "about.pdf" for more details and explanations.
